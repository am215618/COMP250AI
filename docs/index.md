# A technical report on an AI for solving a sliding puzzle independently

research statement/arguement
A* is the best way of solving sliding puzzles with AI.

## Research

### Defence of Arguements

Methods chosen to solve it (A-Star)
Comparison
The A* Sorting algorithm is the most efficent way of solving a sliding puzzle, as it always going to find the shortest path to the goal state.

Normally, an A* algorithm is found using the sum of an estimate of the distance between the initial and goal states, as well as the actual distance, calculated using Djikstra if it is required.
In the case of a sliding puzzle, the estimate is the number of misplaced tiles and the number of moves from its initial state.

sum up alternatives

A* will always find the shortest route to the goal.

A* does have a complexity problem.

### Appropriateness of Practice-Based Research Methods
Coming soon...

### Application of Academic Conventions
Coming soon...


advantages and disadvantages
A*:
+: always finds the shortest path to solving a puzzle
+: much faster at finding a solution than alternatives.

-: very complicated.
-: algorithm is complete if the branching factor is finite and every action has a fixed cost.
